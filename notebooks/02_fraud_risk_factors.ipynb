        "1. **Bill-and-Hold Revenue Recognition Scheme** - UMD pressured distributors to purchase product in advance of final customer demand and agreed to hold inventory in UMD's warehouse, creating risk of premature revenue recognition\n",
        "2. **Revenue Cutoff Manipulation** - 214% YoY Q4 growth spike coinciding with capital raise timing suggests potential period-end gaming and improper revenue cutoff\n",
        "3. **Management Override of Controls** - SVP has unusually broad authority over entire revenue cycle with revenue-based compensation and aggressive, unreachable sales targets\n",

        "The case explicitly states: *\"These circumstances presented a problem for the Company, because the distributors began to ask for concessions from Urgent Medical. For example, in order to persuade the distributors, the Company agreed to hold the inventory in their own warehouse.\"*\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a classic **bill-and-hold arrangement** where:\n",
        "- UMD invoices the distributor (triggering revenue recognition)\n",
        "- But UMD retains physical possession of the goods\n",
        "- Distributor hasn't taken delivery or assumed risk of ownership\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Could Go Wrong\n",
        "\n",
        "**Revenue Recognition Before Earning:**\n",
        "- Revenue is recognized when goods are invoiced (per UMD's policy), but goods haven't actually shipped\n",
        "- Risks and rewards of ownership haven't transferred to the distributor\n",
        "- Distributors may have informal agreements to return goods or cancel orders\n",
        "- Goods may never actually leave UMD's warehouse despite being \"sold\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Specific Concerns:**\n",
        "1. Were the goods actually segregated and identified for specific distributors?\n",
        "2. Did distributors have an unconditional obligation to pay?\n",
        "3. Could distributors cancel or return the goods through side agreements?\n",
        "4. The case states \"sales terms do not include any refund or rebate conditions\" - but were there informal understandings?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Financial Statement Assertions Affected\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Existence/Occurrence** - Did the sale transaction actually occur as a legitimate economic event?\n",
        "2. **Cutoff** - Was revenue recognized in the correct period (when earned, not just when invoiced)?\n",
        "3. **Rights and Obligations** - Has UMD actually transferred the risks and rewards of ownership?\n",

        "- Sales team \"began to exert pressure on a number of distributors\" to purchase product\n",
        "- **Result: Q4 2017 sales increased 214% year-over-year**\n",
        "- Early 2018: UMD successfully raised $40 million in investment capital\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Red Flag:** The dramatic Q4 spike occurred precisely when management needed to show strong results to investors. This timing is extremely suspicious.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Could Go Wrong\n",
        "\n",
        "**Period-End Gaming:**\n",
        "1. **Early shipment recording** - Goods shipped in January 2018 recorded as December 2017 sales\n",
        "2. **Invoice backdating** - InvoiceDate manipulated to fall in 2017 when actual transaction was 2018\n",
        "3. **Shipping document manipulation** - ShipDate altered to appear as if delivery occurred before year-end\n",
        "4. **Sales orders dated but not fulfilled** - Orders taken in late December but never actually shipped\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why This Matters:**\n",
        "- UMD's revenue recognition policy: \"The Company invoices customers when goods are shipped, and invoicing triggers the recording of revenue\"\n",
        "- If goods weren't actually shipped by 12/31/2017, revenue was recognized prematurely\n",
        "- The case specifically notes audit concern about \"significant risk of sales cutoff related to the launch of the new surgical implant\"\n",

        "- **Incentive:** $40M capital raise depended on showing strong 2017 results; compensation tied to revenue; job security threatened\n",

        "- **Rationalization:** \"These sales would have happened anyway, we're just helping them along\"; \"We need this capital to save the company\"\n",
