    "# Requirement 2: Data Reconciliation to Trial Balance\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## ANSWER TO REQUIREMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirement 2a:** The $84,867,855 sales revenue is comprised of **1,158 sales order records** with InvoiceDate in calendar year 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirement 2b:** The $11,988,886 gross accounts receivable is comprised of **148 invoice records** that were outstanding (unpaid) as of 12/31/2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings:\n",
    "- **Revenue Recognition:** 1,158 of 1,168 total sales orders (99.1%) were invoiced in 2017\n",
    "- **AR Composition:** The 148 outstanding invoices include:\n",
    "  - 31 invoices still unpaid as of data extraction (PaidDate = 9/9/9999)\n",
    "  - 117 invoices paid AFTER 12/31/2017 (but were in AR at year-end)\n",
    "- **Collection Performance:** 87.2% of 2017 invoices were collected by year-end (1,010 paid by 12/31/2017)\n",
    "- **Reconciliation:** Both amounts match the trial balance exactly ($0.08 rounding difference on AR)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Actions:\n",
    "- Perform aging analysis on the 148 AR invoices to identify collection risk (Requirement 6)\n",
    "- Investigate the 31 invoices still unpaid - some may be significantly past due\n",
    "- Review Q4 spike in revenue and its impact on year-end AR balance\n",
    "- Analyze payment patterns - why were 117 invoices paid in early 2018?\n",

    "## Summary & Audit Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the Data Shows\n",
    "\n",
    "Our reconciliation successfully tied the trial balance amounts to the underlying transaction data with **near-perfect accuracy**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Revenue ($84,867,855):** Comprises 1,158 sales orders that were invoiced during calendar year 2017. This represents 99.1% of all sales orders in the database, indicating that nearly all transactions were completed and invoiced in 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accounts Receivable ($11,988,886):** Comprises 148 invoices that were outstanding (unpaid) as of 12/31/2017. These break down as:\n",
    "   - 31 invoices still unpaid as of data extraction (21%)\n",
    "   - 117 invoices paid in early 2018 (79%)\n",
    "   - The 148 invoices represent 12.8% of 2017 invoices, meaning 87.2% were collected by year-end\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters for the Audit\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strong Collection Performance - Or Is It?** At first glance, an 87% collection rate within the same year appears healthy. However, several factors raise concerns:\n",
    "- The AR balance of $12M represents 14.1% of annual revenue, which is relatively high\n",
    "- 117 invoices were paid in early 2018 - this could indicate normal 30-60 day terms OR collection issues\n",
    "- 31 invoices remain unpaid - need to determine how old these are (aging analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4 Revenue Spike Impact:** The case mentions Q4 2017 sales increased 214% YoY. Key questions:\n",
    "- Are the 148 AR invoices concentrated in Q4? (analyzed in this notebook)\n",
    "- Were Q4 sales legitimate or the result of channel stuffing / bill-and-hold arrangements?\n",
    "- Did distributors request extended payment terms to take Q4 shipments?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bill-and-Hold Concerns:** The case mentions \"the Company agreed to hold the inventory in their own warehouse\" for some distributors. This raises serious revenue recognition issues:\n",
    "- If goods weren't delivered, revenue recognition may be premature\n",
    "- Need to identify which of the 148 AR invoices (if any) relate to bill-and-hold arrangements\n",
    "- Such arrangements would violate proper revenue recognition principles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Affected Assertions:**\n",
    "- **Existence/Occurrence:** Need to verify the 148 AR invoices represent legitimate, delivered sales\n",
    "- **Cutoff:** Critical to ensure Q4 revenue was recognized in the correct period (not bill-and-hold)\n",
    "- **Valuation:** Need to assess collectability of the $12M AR, especially the 31 still-unpaid invoices\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** Verify amounts are calculated correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Further Testing is Recommended\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Aging Analysis (Requirement 6):** Determine how many of the 148 AR invoices are >90 days past due as of 12/31/2017\n",
    "2. **Bill-and-Hold Investigation:** Identify which AR invoices (if any) involve inventory held at UMD's warehouse\n",
    "3. **Three-Way Match (Requirement 3):** Confirm all 1,158 revenue transactions have proper documentation (order → shipment → invoice)\n",
    "4. **Credit Limit Testing (Requirements 4-5):** Verify if any AR balances exceed authorized credit limits\n",
    "5. **Q4 Revenue Testing:** Examine shipping documents for Q4 sales to verify actual delivery to customers\n",
    "6. **Customer Concentration:** Identify if the $12M AR is concentrated with specific customers or territories (potential fraud indicator)\n",
    "7. **Subsequent Collections:** Verify that the 117 invoices marked as \"paid in 2018\" were actually collected\n"
