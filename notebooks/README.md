# UMD Audit Analysis - Notebooks

How to Use These Notebooks

**Each notebook is SELF-CONTAINED and answers one requirement completely.**

### How to Find Answers:
1. **Open the notebook for your requirement** (e.g., `03_three_way_match.ipynb` for Requirement 3)
2. **Scroll to the TOP** ‚Üí Read the "üìã ANSWER TO REQUIREMENT" section
3. **Scroll to the BOTTOM** ‚Üí Read the "üìä Summary & Audit Implications" section
4. **Copy findings directly into your memo** (numbers, patterns, recommendations)
5. **Use output files** from `outputs/tables/` and `outputs/figures/`

**You should NEVER need to read the Python code to understand the findings.**

## Workflow

```
1. Analyst creates self-contained notebooks (02 ‚Üí 06)
   ‚Üì
2. Each notebook has findings at top & bottom
   ‚Üì
3. Each notebook generates outputs/
   ‚Üì
4. Memo writer opens notebooks + reads findings
   ‚Üì
5. Memo gets written! 
```

## How to Use These Notebooks

### If You're the Analyst:

1. Run notebooks in order (01 ‚Üí 06)
2. **Put findings at TOP of each notebook** (in markdown)
3. **Put summary at BOTTOM of each notebook** (audit implications)
4. Generate outputs (tables/figures) as you go
5. Make sure findings are specific with numbers and patterns
6. Explain everything in business/audit terms

## Quick Tips

### For Analysis Quality:

 Be specific (numbers, dates, customer IDs)
 Explain patterns (not just "there are exceptions")
 Consider audit implications (what assertions are at risk?)
 Suggest next steps (what further testing is needed?)

### For Memo Writing:

 Use professional audit language
 Reference specific evidence (tables, figures)
 Connect findings to fraud risks
 Be objective but direct about concerns
