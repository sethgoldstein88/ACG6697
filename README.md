## How to Use This Repository

### For Memo Writers

**Each notebook answers one specific requirement:**

1. Open any notebook (click on `.ipynb` files in `notebooks/` folder)
2. **Scroll to TOP** ‚Üí See "ANSWER TO REQUIREMENT" section with key findings
3. **Scroll to BOTTOM** ‚Üí See "Summary & Audit Implications" section
4. Download supporting files from `outputs/` folder as needed

**You don't need to run any code - just read the notebooks!**

### Notebooks Overview

| Notebook | Requirement | Key Finding |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `02_fraud_risk_factors.ipynb` | Req 1: Fraud Risk Factors | Bill-and-hold, cutoff manipulation, management override |
| `02_reconciliation.ipynb` | Req 2: Revenue/AR Reconciliation | 1,158 records = $84.9M; 148 invoices = $12M AR |
| `03_three_way_match.ipynb` | Req 3: Three-Way Match | 2 exceptions: $171K invoiced but not shipped |
| `04_credit_analysis.ipynb` | Req 4-5: Credit Limits | No violations found (but 22 limits increased in Q4) |
| `05_aging_analysis.ipynb` | Req 6: Aging Analysis | 5 invoices >90 days; allowance inadequate |
| `06_fraud_detection.ipynb` | Req 7: Additional Analysis | Dec 31 concentration, credit manipulation |

## Key Findings Summary

### Critical Issues Identified:

1. **Three-Way Match Failures**
   - 2 invoices ($171,080) recognized without shipment
   - Both on December 31, 2017 (cutoff manipulation)

2. **Period-End Revenue Stuffing**
   - $1.8M in revenue (2.1% of total) recorded on December 31 alone
   - Pattern consistent with channel stuffing

3. **Credit Limit Manipulation**
   - 22 distributors (30% of customer base) had credit limits increased in Q4 2017
   - Explains why no "over limit" exceptions found

4. **Collection Risk**
   - 31 invoices ($2.6M) remain completely unpaid
   - 148 invoices ($12M) outstanding at year-end

5. **Inadequate Allowance**
   - Current allowance: $315,000
   - Recommended based on aging: $707,000
   - Shortfall: $392,000

### Audit Assertions at Risk:

- ‚ùå **Existence/Occurrence** - Failed (invoiced but not shipped)
- ‚ùå **Cutoff** - Failed (December 31 concentration)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Valuation** - Concern (inadequate allowance)
- ‚úÖ **Accuracy** - Passed (reconciliation complete)
