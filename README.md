# UMD Audit Analysis

Comprehensive data analysis for the Urgent Medical Device (UMD) audit case, examining potential revenue fraud in fiscal year 2017.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes sales, shipments, invoices, and customer data to identify fraud risk factors and control failures in UMD's revenue recognition process. The analysis supports an academic audit memo examining $84.9M in revenue and $12M in accounts receivable.

## Key Findings

- **Three-Way Match Exceptions**: 2 invoices totaling $171K recognized without shipment
- **Period-End Revenue Concentration**: $1.8M (2.1% of revenue) recorded on December 31 alone
- **Credit Limit Manipulation**: 22 distributors (30%) had limits increased in Q4 2017
- **Collection Risk**: 31 invoices ($2.6M) remain completely unpaid
- **Inadequate Allowance**: Current reserve $315K vs. recommended $707K
