# UMD Audit Case - Project Context & Guidelines

## Project Overview

This is the **UMD (Urgent Medical Device) audit case** - an academic group project where I am performing data analysis to support my teammates in writing a professional audit memo. The case involves analyzing revenue and accounts receivable for potential fraud in fiscal year 2017.

## Required Context Files

When working on this project, **always** have access to:

1. **`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`** (this file) - Structure, standards, deliverables
2. **`umdcase.md`** - Case background, requirements, data dictionary
3. **`data/` folder** - Source Excel files

Without umdcase.md, the agent won't understand:

- Business context (fraud risks, pressure to meet targets)
- Specific requirement questions to answer
- Data definitions (what does PaidDate = 9/9/9999 mean?)
- Audit implications (why bill-and-hold matters)

## Key Constraint: Analysis for Non-Technical Teammates

**My teammates need to write a professional audit memo but should NOT need to:**

- Run or understand Python code
- Debug notebooks
- Figure out what findings mean
- Hunt through cells to find answers

**They MUST be able to:**

- Open a notebook and immediately see the answer to that requirement
- Copy/paste exception lists into their memo
- Use pre-generated visualizations
- Understand the business significance of findings
- Trace findings back to methodology if needed

## Required Structure: Multiple Focused Notebooks (Self-Contained)

### Directory Structure

```

  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [helper functions if needed]
```

**Philosophy:** Each notebook is SELF-CONTAINED. A teammate should be able to open notebook 03 and immediately find the answer to Requirement 3 without opening any other files.

### Notebook Standards

**Critical:** Use the `edit_notebook` tool to create/edit notebooks.

Each notebook MUST be self-contained and answer its requirement completely. Structure:

1. **Header Section (Markdown Cell at Top) - THE ANSWER**

   ```markdown
   # Requirement X: [Title]
   
   ---
   
   ## üìã ANSWER TO REQUIREMENT
   
   **[Direct answer to the case question in 2-3 sentences]**
   
   ### Key Findings:
   - Finding 1: [Specific number/count + business significance]
   - Finding 2: [Specific number/count + business significance]
   - Finding 3: [Pattern identified]
   
   ### Recommended Actions:
   - [What should auditors do next?]
   
   ---
   
   ## Data Sources
   - [Which Excel files used]
   
   ## Outputs Generated
   - outputs/tables/[filename].csv
   - outputs/figures/[filename].png
   ```

2. **Analysis Sections**

   - Clear markdown headers for each analytical step
   - Code cells with inline comments explaining logic
   - **Markdown cells AFTER each major analysis step interpreting results**
   - Don't just show DataFrames - explain what they mean in audit terms

3. **Footer Section**

   ```markdown
   ## üìä Summary & Audit Implications
   
   [2-3 paragraphs explaining]:
   - What the data shows
   - Why this matters for the audit (which assertions affected)
   - What the pattern suggests about fraud risk
   - What further testing is recommended
   ```

**The teammate should be able to scroll to the top and bottom of the notebook to get everything they need for the memo WITHOUT reading code.**

## Output File Standards

### CSV Files (outputs/tables/)

- Include column headers
- Sort by significance (highest $ amount first, or most suspicious)
- Include enough context columns (CustomerID, InvoiceID, Amount, Date, etc.)
- No raw Python index columns
- Ready to import into Word/Excel

### Figures (outputs/figures/)

- High DPI (300) for print quality
- Clear titles and axis labels
- Audit-appropriate styling (professional, not flashy)
- Include source note if relevant
- File naming: descriptive (e.g., `q4_revenue_spike_by_territory.png`)

## Code Quality Standards

1. **Pandas Best Practices**

   - Use clear variable names (not `df1`, `df2`)
   - Chain operations when readable
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Handle missing data explicitly

2. **Reproducibility**

   - All notebooks should run top-to-bottom without errors
   - Use relative paths from project root
   - Don't hard-code values that come from data
   - Clear any notebook output before committing (optional)

3. **Documentation**
   - Explain WHY, not just WHAT
   - Interpret results in business terms
   - Call out audit implications

## Data Files Location

All source data is in `data/` directory:

- `UMD_Data Set_Sales Orders.xlsx`
- `UMD_Data Set_Shipments.xlsx`
- `UMD_Data Set_Customer Invoices.xlsx`
- `UMD_Data Set_Customer Master.xlsx`
- `UMD_Data Set_Sales Territory.xlsx`
- `UMD_Data Set_Products.xlsx`

## Case Requirements Summary

See `umdcase.md` for full details. Key deliverables:

1. Identify 3 fraud risk factors (6 pts)
2. Data reconciliation - tie to trial balance (8 pts)
3. Three-way match analysis (6 pts)
4. Sales without credit limits (4 pts)
5. AR exceeding credit limits (6 pts)
6. Aging analysis - compare to client's list (12 pts)
7. Additional fraud analysis (24 pts)
8. Who to interview? (4 pts)

**Total: 70 points**

## When Helping Me:

### DO:
‚úÖ Put the ANSWER at the top of each notebook (in markdown)
‚úÖ Create outputs (CSV, figures) that teammates can directly use
‚úÖ Explain findings in audit/business terms within the notebook
‚úÖ Generate clear visualizations with context
‚úÖ Identify patterns and explain their significance
‚úÖ Add interpretation markdown cells after major analysis steps
‚úÖ Save all outputs to appropriate directories
‚úÖ Include a summary section at the bottom of each notebook

### DON'T:
‚ùå Create notebooks without clear findings at the top
‚ùå Generate code without interpretation
‚ùå Leave findings as "there's an anomaly" without business context
‚ùå Assume teammates will read the code to understand results
‚ùå Make assumptions about fraud without evidence
‚ùå Forget to save tables/figures to outputs/
‚ùå Try to maintain a separate summary document (focus on the notebook itself)

## Success Criteria

The project is successful when my teammates can:

1. Open notebook 02, scroll to the top, and immediately see the answer to Requirement 2
2. Copy specific numbers, patterns, and insights from notebook headers/footers into their memo
3. Insert professional visualizations from `outputs/figures/`
4. Understand the audit significance without reading any Python code
5. Complete their memo without asking me "what did you find for requirement X?"

**Each notebook should tell a complete story: Question ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Answer ‚Üí Implications**

---

**Remember:** This is an AUDIT case. Findings should be:

- Specific (numbers, dates, customer IDs)
- Evidence-based (traceable to data)
- Professionally communicated (appropriate for stakeholders)
- Risk-focused (what assertions are affected, what could go wrong)
