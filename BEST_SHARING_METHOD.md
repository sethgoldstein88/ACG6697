# Best Way to Share This Project With Teammates

## TL;DR: Choose Based on Your Needs

**Your teammates just need to READ findings for their memo?**
→ Use **GitHub** or **HTML Export** (NO CODE EXECUTION NEEDED)

**Teammates need to RE-RUN analysis with updated data?**
→ Use **Google Colab** (RARE - only if data changes)

## Comparison Table

| Method | Setup Time | Teammates Need | Best When | Cost |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-----------|------|
| **GitHub** | 5 min | Web browser | Reading findings, professional sharing | Free |
| **HTML Export** | 2 min | Web browser | Quick share, no GitHub account | Free |
| **Google Colab** | 10 min | Google account | Need to re-run code | Free |
| **Jupyter nbviewer** | 1 min | Web browser | Quick preview link | Free |

## Method 1: GitHub (BEST for Portfolio + Collaboration)

### Why This is Best:
- Teammates view notebooks in browser (no setup)
- Shows all findings, charts, tables perfectly
- You can update findings, teammates see changes
- Looks professional (good for resume)
- Download individual CSV/PNG files easily

### Setup (5 minutes):

```bash
cd /Users/sethgoldstein/ACG6697

# Initialize git
git init
git add notebooks/ outputs/ *.md
git add data/*.xlsx  # Only if data is not confidential
git commit -m "UMD audit analysis complete"

# Push to GitHub (create repo first at github.com)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/umd-audit-analysis.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Teammates Access:
1. Click: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/umd-audit-analysis`
2. Browse to `notebooks/03_three_way_match.ipynb`
3. GitHub renders it → see all findings!
4. Download files from `outputs/tables/` if needed

**Security Note:** If data is confidential, make repo private and add teammates as collaborators.

## Method 2: HTML Export (EASIEST - 2 minutes)

### Why This Works:
- No accounts needed
- Works offline
- Looks exactly like Jupyter
- Share via Google Drive, email, Dropbox, etc.

### Setup:

```bash
cd /Users/sethgoldstein/ACG6697
./export_notebooks_html.sh
```

This creates `exports_for_teammates/` folder with:
- All notebooks as HTML files
- All output files (CSV, PNG)

### Share:
1. Upload `exports_for_teammates/` folder to Google Drive
2. Share folder with teammates
3. They double-click any `.html` file → opens in browser
4. That's it!

---

## Method 3: Google Colab (Only if teammates need to RE-RUN code)

### When to Use:
- Data gets updated and teammates need to re-run analysis
- Teammates want to modify your code
- You're teaching them Python

### When NOT to Use:
- Teammates just writing a memo (they don't need to run code!)
- Findings are already complete
- You're the only analyst

**See `GOOGLE_COLAB_SETUP.md` if you need this.**

---

## Method 4: Jupyter nbviewer (QUICKEST for Preview)

### Setup (literally 1 minute):

1. Upload notebooks to GitHub (see Method 1)
2. Go to: https://nbviewer.org
3. Paste your GitHub notebook URL
4. Share the nbviewer link with teammates

**Example:**
```
https://nbviewer.org/github/YOUR_USERNAME/umd-audit-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/03_three_way_match.ipynb
```

Teammates click link → see notebook beautifully rendered!

## My Recommendation for Your Situation

Based on your `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` where teammates "should NOT need to run or understand Python code":

### **Use GitHub (Method 1)**

**Why:**
1. ✓ Teammates just browse and read findings
2. ✓ No setup required for them
3. ✓ Professional (good for your resume)
4. ✓ Easy to update if you find more issues
5. ✓ Can download CSV/PNG files individually
6. ✓ Version control if you make changes

### Quick Start:

```bash
# 1. Create repo at github.com (name it "umd-audit-analysis")

# 2. Run these commands:
cd /Users/sethgoldstein/ACG6697
git init
git add .
git commit -m "UMD audit analysis - all requirements complete"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/umd-audit-analysis.git
git push -u origin main

# 3. Share link with teammates:
# "Check out notebooks/03_three_way_match.ipynb for Requirement 3 findings"
```

**If data is confidential:** Make repo private, add teammates as collaborators.

**If you don't want GitHub:** Use Method 2 (HTML export) - 2 minutes, share via Drive.

## What About the Outputs?

All methods give teammates access to:
- `outputs/tables/*.csv` - Exception lists, ready for Excel/Word
- `outputs/figures/*.png` - Charts for the memo
- Notebook findings - Text to copy/paste into memo

---

## Decision Tree

```
Do teammates need to RE-RUN your analysis?
│
├─ YES → Use Google Colab (rare for this project)
│
└─ NO → Do you want version control + portfolio?
    │
    ├─ YES → Use GitHub (RECOMMENDED)
    │
    └─ NO → Use HTML Export (super easy)
```

---

## Bottom Line

**For your UMD audit project where teammates are writing a memo:**

1. **GitHub is best** - professional, easy, no setup for teammates
2. **HTML export is easiest** - 2 minutes, works anywhere
3. **Google Colab is overkill** - only if they need to re-run code

Since your notebooks have findings at the TOP and BOTTOM (as designed), teammates just need to READ them, not run them.

## Need Help?

- **GitHub setup:** https://docs.github.com/en/get-started
- **HTML export:** Just run `./export_notebooks_html.sh`
- **Still want Colab:** See `GOOGLE_COLAB_SETUP.md`
